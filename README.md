# webScrapping

Scrapping worldometer website for countrwise covid stats and creating a csv file out of it. Web scrapping is used because Worldometer doesn't provide any known api for the datatable displayed in the UI.

# Python version

Python 3.10.0

# Libraries

Scrapy 2.5.1
pip install scrapy

# Scrapy project name

CovidStats

# Execution

> > cd WorldCovidStat/CovidStat
> > scrapy crawl covid

This will generate some logs generated by the scrapy library and a csv file will be dumped named WorldCovidStat\CovidStats\worldometer_corona_stat.csv
The file has the below headers:-
last_update_time, country_name, total_case, new_case, total_deaths, new_deaths, total_recovered, active_cases, critical_cases, total_case_per_million, total_death_per_million, total_tests, total_tests_per_million
